> R. Guo. The electron acoustic waves in plasmas with two kappa-distributed electrons at the same temperatures and immobile ions. Phys. Plasmas 28, 082105 (2021); doi: 10.1063/5.0057693.

- The electron acoustic waves are always considered to exist in plasmas with hot and cool electrons in the previous literature.
- However, in the present paper, we report that the electron acoustic waves can also be weakly damped in plasmas consisting of two kappa-distributed electrons at the same temperatures.
- It could be regarded as a novel generation mechanism of the weakly damped electron acoustic waves.
