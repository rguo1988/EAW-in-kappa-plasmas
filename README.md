> R. Guo. The electron acoustic waves in plasmas with two kappa-distributed electrons at the same temperatures and immobile ions. Phys. Plasmas 28, 082105 (2021); doi: 10.1063/5.0057693.

The electron acoustic waves are always considered to exist in two-temperature plasmas in the previous literature. However, the present paper reports that the electron acoustic waves can propagate in plasmas consisting of two kappa-distributed electrons at the same temperatures. It could be regarded as a novel generation mechanism of the weakly damped electron acoustic waves.
